So what is the main difference when using PHP shell script?

When using php script as shell script, it will automaticly qualify for system concept of shell scripts, meaning:

    1. Can have persmission mode and execution flag
    2. Can be installed in /usr/local or /usr/bin folder and executed as simple as any linux/unix programm
    3. Can be used by systemctl when configured as system service etc
